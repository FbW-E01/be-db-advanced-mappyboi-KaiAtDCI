# Mappy boi project

This project is a pre-alpha prototype of an app with which regular citizens could report abandoned bicycles (and maybe more?) to their municipality. It is far from complete!

> Before starting with the task, have a look around the code!
> **NOTE:** There is 217 lines of relevant code/markup in all these files - it's less than you would think and it's not a bad idea to spend time going through all the files here!

## BACKEND

- `$ npm i`
- `$ npm run dev`

## FRONTED

- `$ npm i`
- `$ npm start`

# TASK

- Add your answers here and code your solutions normally.

1. Make it so that our frontend is able to actually send reports to the backend
2. Make it so that our backend is able to save the reports to a database
3. Make use of Schemas and Models in the backend!
4. What are the commit messages of the three previous commits to this repo? And who made them?  
   ``Answer: No idea``
5. What is a captcha?  
   ``Answer: (Source: Wikipedia) A CAPTCHA (/kæp.tʃə/, a contrived acronym for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart") is a type of challenge–response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human.``
6. Spend a maximum of 10 minutes on this question: how would you design a captcha for this form?  
   `Answer: I would not code it on my own in case of such an app and use established solution because deCAPTCHA-algorithms are said to be very strong already.`
7. **BONUS** Get all notifications from the backend and somehow show them in the fronted
8. **SUPER BONUS** Implement a captcha for this form without using any extra npm dependencies
9. **XTRA BONUS** Make the frontend look 𝓖𝓸𝓸𝓭
